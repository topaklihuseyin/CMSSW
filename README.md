# CMSSW

## Overview
The overall collection of software, referred to as CMSSW, is built around a Framework, an Event Data Model (EDM), and Services needed by the simulation, calibration and alignment, and reconstruction modules that process event data so that physicists can perform analysis. The primary goal of the Framework and EDM is to facilitate the development and deployment of reconstruction and analysis software.

The CMSSW event processing model consists of one executable, called cmsRun, and many plug-in modules which are managed by the Framework. All the code needed in the event processing (calibration, reconstruction algorithms, etc.) is contained in the modules. The same executable is used for both detector and Monte Carlo data.

The CMSSW executable, cmsRun, is configured at run time by the user's job-specific [configuration file](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookConfigFileIntro). This file tells cmsRun
- which data to use
- which modules to execute
- which parameter settings to use for each module
- what is the order or the executions of modules, called *path*
- how the events are filtered within each path, and
- how the paths are connected to the output files

cmsRun is extremely lightweight: only the required modules are dynamically loaded at the beginning of the job. More information can be found [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookCMSSWFramework).

## Data Model
The CMS Event Data Model (EDM) is centered around the concept of an *Event*. Physically, an event is the result of a single readout of the detector electronics and the signals that will (in general) have been generated by particles, tracks, energy deposits, present in a number of bunch crossings. 

In software terms, an Event starts as a collection of the RAW data from a detector or MC event, stored as a single entity in memory, a C++ type-safe container called edm::Event. An Event is a C++ object container for all RAW and reconstructed data related to a particular collision. During processing, data are passed from one module to the next via the Event, and are accessed only through the Event. All objects in the Event may be individually or collectively stored in ROOT files, and are thus directly browsable in ROOT. This allows tests to be run on individual modules in isolation. Auxiliary information needed to process an Event is called Event Setup, and is accessed via the EventSetup.

#### The CMS Data Hierarchy 
CMS Data is arranged into a hierarchy of data tiers. Each physics event is written into each data tier, where the tiers each contain different levels of information about the event. The different tiers each have different uses. The three main data tiers written in CMS are:
1. RAW: full event information from the Tier-0 (i.e. from CERN), containing 'raw' detector information (detector element hits, etc)
   - RAW is not used directly for analysis
   
2. RECO ("RECOnstructed data"): the output from first-pass processing by the Tier-0. This layer contains reconstructed physics objects, but it's still very detailed. 
    - RECO can be used for analysis, but is too big for frequent or heavy use when CMS has collected a substantial data sample.
    
3. AOD ("Analysis Object Data"): this is a "distilled" version of the RECO event information, and is expected to be used for most analyses.
   - AOD provides a trade-off between event size and complexity of the available information to optimize flexibility and speed for analyses.

The data tiers are described in more detail in a dedicated WorkBook chapter on [Data Formats and Tiers](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookDataFormats). 

#### Detector data flow through Hardware Tiers
The following diagram shows the flow of CMS detector data through the tiers.
![alt text](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/WorkBookComputingModel/dataflowtiers_Data.gif)
The essential elements of the flow of real physics data through the hardware tiers are:
- T0 to T1:
   - Scheduled, time-critical, will be continuous during data-taking periods
   - reliable transfer needed for fast access to new data, and to ensure that data is stored safely
- T1 to T1:
     - redistributing data, generally after reprocessing (e.g. processing with improved algorithms)
- T1 to T2:
    - Data for analysis at Tier-2s
    
 #### Monte Carlo data flow through Hardware Tiers
 Monte Carlo generated data is typically produced at a T2 center, and archived at its associated T1 and made available to the whole CMS collaboration. The following diagram shows the flow of Monte Carlo data through the tiers.

## Analyzers
First, a few general words about analysis in the CMSSW framework. Physics analysis proceeds via a series of subsequent steps. Building blocks are identified and more complex objects are built on top of them. For instance, the Higgs search H ->ZZ -> µµµµ requires:
 - identifying muon candidates;
 - reconstructing Z candidates starting from muon candidates;
 - reconstructing Higgs candidates starting from Z candidates.
 
This process clearly identifies three products: muon candidates, Z candidates, and a Higgs candidate, as well as three processes to reconstruct them. These are well mapped into three Framework modules (EDProducers) that add into the Event three different products (the candidates collections). For more information click [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookWriteFrameworkModule).

When setting up code for the new EDM (such as creating a new EDProducer) there is a fair amount of 'boiler plate' code that you must write. To make writing such code easier CMS provides a series of scripts that will generate the necessary directory structure and files needed so that all you need to do is write your actual algorithms.

CMSSW distiguishes following [module types](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMSSWatFNALFramework#Module_types):
 - **EDAnalyzer:** takes input from the event and processes the input without writing information back to the event
 - **EDProducer:** takes input from the event and produces new output which is saved in the event
 - **EDFilter:** decides if processing the event can be stopped and continued
 - **EventSetup:** external service not bound to the event structure which provides information useable by all modules (e.g. Geometry, Magnetic Field, etc.)
  
  In order to generate above modules:
   - **mkedanlzr :** makes a skeleton of a package containing an [EDAnalyzer](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMSSWatFNALFramework#Module_types) 
   - **mkedprod :** makes a skeleton of a package containing an [EDProducer](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMSSWatFNALFramework#Module_types)  
   - **mkedfltr :** makes a skeleton of a package containing an [EDFilter](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMSSWatFNALFramework#Module_types)
   - **mkrecord :** makes a complete implementation of a Record used by the [EventSetup](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/CMSSWatFNALFramework#Module_types)
   
More generators are available and you can find them [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideSkeletonCodeGenerator) 


## Configure

### Set up your Environment
If you have an account on *lxplus* or *cmslpc* clusters, you can login one of these clusters using *ssh* command.
 - ssh -Y [yourusername]@lxplus.cern.ch  
 *make a your working directory*

```javascript
 mkdir MYDEMOANALYZER
 cd MYDEMOANALYZER
```

```html
# if output of echo $0 is csh or tcsh
   setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc6_amd64_gcc491

# if output of echo $0 is bash/sh
   export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc491

# check your arch - it should give an output as slc6_amd64_gcc491
   echo $SCRAM_ARCH
```
```javascript
 # create a new project area 
 cmsrel CMSSW_7_4_15 
 echo $0

 cd CMSSW_7_4_15/src/ 
 cmsenv
 ```

### Write a Framework Module

First, create a subsystem area. The actual name used for the directory is not important, we'll use Demo. For more information click [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookWriteFrameworkModule). From the src directory, make and change to the Demo area:

```javascript
mkdir Demo
cd Demo
```
Note that if you do not create the subsystem area and create you module directly under the src directory, your code will not compile. Create the "skeleton" of an EDAnalyzer module (see [SWGuideSkeletonCodeGenerator for more information](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideSkeletonCodeGenerator)):

```javascript
mkedanlzr DemoAnalyzer
```
Compile the code:

```javascript
cd DemoAnalyzer
scram b
```
We'll use a ROOT file as the data source when we run with this module. The data source is defined in the configuration file. For your convenience, there is already a data file processed in **CMSSW_5_3_4**, which is fully compatible with **CMSSW_7_4_15** release, containing 100 events. It is located at `/afs/cern.ch/cms/Tutorials/TWIKI_DATA/TTJets_8TeV_53X.root`.

The **mkedanlzr** script has generated an example python configuration file ConfFile_cfg.py in the **~DemoAnalyzer/python** directory. Open the file using your favorite text editor and change the data source file to as shown below.

And now the configuration file should read like this:

```javascript
import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms

process = cms.Process("Demo")

process.load("FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi")

process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(-1) )

process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource",
                                # replace 'myfile.root' with the source file you want to use
                                fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(
            'file:/afs/cern.ch/cms/Tutorials/TWIKI_DATA/TTJets_8TeV_53X.root'
                )
                            )

process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer'
                              )

process.p = cms.Path(process.demo)
```

Full documentation about the configuration language is in [SWGuideAboutPythonConfigFile](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideAboutPythonConfigFile).

Run the job

```javascript
cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/python/ConfFile_cfg.py
```

### Get tracks from the Event
`Demo/DemoAnalyzer/plugins/DemoAnalyzer.cc` is the place to put your analysis code. In this example, we only add very simple statement printing the number of tracks.

Edit `Demo/DemoAnalyzer/plugins/BuildFile.xml:` so that it looks like this
```javascript
<use name="FWCore/Framework"/>
<use name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
<use name="FWCore/ParameterSet"/>
<use name="DataFormats/TrackReco"/>
<use name="CommonTools/UtilAlgos"/>
<flags EDM_PLUGIN="1"/>
```
More on information on the structure of a typical `BuildFile.xml` can be found on [WorkBookBuildFilesIntro](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookBuildFilesIntro).

Edit `Demo/DemoAnalyzer/plugins/DemoAnalyzer.cc`
 - Add the following include statements (together with the other include statements):

```javascript
#include "DataFormats/TrackReco/interface/Track.h"
#include "DataFormats/TrackReco/interface/TrackFwd.h"
#include "FWCore/MessageLogger/interface/MessageLogger.h"
```
- Edit the method `analyze` which starts with

```javascript
DemoAnalyzer::analyze(const edm::Event& iEvent, const edm::EventSetup& iSetup)
```
and put the following lines below `using namespace edm;`

```javascript
Handle<reco::TrackCollection> tracks; 
iEvent.getByLabel("generalTracks", tracks);
LogInfo ("Demo") << "number of tracks " << tracks->size();
```
To see how to access data from a triggered or simulated physics event look at [SWGuideEDMGetDataFromEvent](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideEDMGetDataFromEvent).

To know what other collections (besides `TrackCollection` of reconstructed objects are available, you can have a look to [SWGuideRecoDataTable](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideRecoDataTable).

Now, compile the code and run the job again:

 ```javascript
 scram b
 cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/python/ConfFile_cfg.py  
  ```
The output should look something like this:

 ```javascript
 [lxplus404 @ ~/workbook/MYDEMOANALYZER/CMSSW_5_3_5/src]$  cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py

## Conditions Data

### Introduction

Conditions data for consumption in CMSSW are defined in the [Offline Conditions Database](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCondDB), which is read in CMSSW applications via [Frontier](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/DatabaseAccess) caching servers. For more information click [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideFrontierConditions).


The set of database tags which together define the offline conditions data are collected together in a Global Tag, which is itself stored in the database. This removes the need for the list of database tags to be defined in separate cffs and therefore decouples the conditions database from the CMSSW release; different Global Tags can be used with a given CMSSW release, with the tag itself specified in the cfg file.

It is then necessary to specify which global tag is to be used, as follows:
 ```javascript
  process.GlobalTag.globaltag = 'GlobalTagName' 
   ```
For example, for a CMSSW job to process simulated dataset produced in the RunIISpring16DR8 80X campaign, you need to :

 ```javascript
 from Configuration.AlCa.GlobalTag import GlobalTag
 process.GlobalTag.globaltag = '80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_miniAODv2_v1' 
  ```
Note that the global tag to be used should always be explicitly specified.

### Browsing the Global Tag content

There are 2 main ways to access the content of a Global Tag:

 - **web interface** for browsing and monitoring the changes to a Global Tag is available:
   - [https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/index/Prod)
 - **command line tool:** the following script can also be run to examine the contents of a global tag
   ```javascript
   cmsenv
   conddb list TAGNAME
   ```
